Please note that this game is still much in development, with me trying to constantly develop and add features to the game.

## Medium

Made in Unity and scripted through C#. All assets were made by me with exception to the asteroid sprites, which can be found [here](https://www.pngaaa.com/detail/2639680).

## Process

After finishing the sentinel tower defense game, I wanted to recreate a classic arcade game. Asteroids seemed like it was the perfect game to recreate since it had somewhat decent complexity to recreate as well as great possibility for extra features/mechanics. I wanted the experience to feel like the old retro asteroids, but more streamlined and modern.

It first started with me finding sprites for the player ship and the asteroids. I then coded the player movement, implementing the ability to shoot shortly after. I then coded asteroids spawning behavior then the interactions once shot by the player. I added animations for the player death, playing an explosion.
